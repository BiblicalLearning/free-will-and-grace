## About This Study

This interactive Bible study explores the profound gift of free will and the greater gift of grace. It examines how our free will naturally inclines toward sin, why the law couldn't cure us, and how God provided grace through sacrifice—ultimately fulfilled in Christ's once-for-all work.

### What You'll Learn

1. **Free Will & Sin Nature** - How our free will naturally inclines toward sin
2. **The Law's Limitation** - Why the law could never cure our condition
3. **Grace Through Sacrifice** - How God showed grace even under the old covenant
4. **Christ's Once-for-All Work** - The perfecting of the saints forever
5. **Obedience by the Spirit** - How obedience flows from grace, not willpower
6. **Free Will for Relationship** - The Prodigal Son and the Father's heart

### Key Truth

> "Grace isn't something we receive after forgiveness. Grace is unmerited favor toward us despite our failure."

> "He is our Father, and free will is the very thing that makes our relationship with Him covenantal and personal."

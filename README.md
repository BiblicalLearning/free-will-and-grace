## 📖 About This Study

Free will is one of the most profound gifts God has given humanity. It allows us to choose—including what to believe. But Scripture reveals that same free will naturally inclines toward sin. The law couldn't cure that.

This is why God established the sacrificial system under the old covenant—grace shown through sacrifice despite our disobedience. And it all pointed forward to Christ, who entered in ONCE, perfecting the saints forever.

This study traces the biblical understanding of free will and grace:

- The reality of free will and its inclination toward sin
- Why the law could never save us
- Grace through the sacrificial system
- Christ's once-for-all finished work
- Obedience that flows from the Spirit, not willpower
- Free will's true purpose: relationship, not earning

## 💡 Key Concepts

### The Human Condition

- Free will is a gift—essential for genuine relationship
- But free will naturally inclines toward sin
- We are free to choose, but not free from our nature

### What Grace Really Is

| Wrong Understanding | Right Understanding |
|---------------------|---------------------|
| Grace received after forgiveness | Grace is unmerited favor despite failure |
| Something we earn | Something freely given |
| A reward | A gift |

### Law vs. Grace

| The Law Could | The Law Could Not |
|---------------|-------------------|
| Show us what sin is | Remove the desire to sin |
| Reveal God's standard | Give us power to meet it |
| Condemn sin | Transform the sinner |
| Point to our need | Be the solution |

### Old Covenant vs. New Covenant

| Old Covenant | New Covenant |
|--------------|--------------|
| Repeated yearly | Once for all |
| Blood of animals | Blood of Christ |
| Covered sin temporarily | Removed sin eternally |
| Priests stood continually | Christ sat down—finished |

### Under Law vs. Under Grace

| Under Law | Under Grace |
|-----------|-------------|
| Obey to be accepted | Accepted, therefore obey |
| Human willpower | Spirit's power |

| Fear of punishment | Love for the Father |

## 🔑 The Truth

**Free will exists not for earning salvation, but for relationship.**

Think of the prodigal son. The father never forced his son to stay or to return. He allowed him to choose, even knowing the outcome. And when the son returned, the father ran to meet him with open arms—no condemnation, only celebration.

That's grace. Unmerited favor toward His creation despite the rebellion.

Without free will, we would be robots. With it, we can be sons and daughters who choose to come home.
